# AnimalShalter
final project
We created an app for our final project, the app itself includes a MySQL database for the different types of animals with an init page. 
For the server, we will be using python flask, which routes traffic for the different HTML pages in the templates folder.
This is supposed to be a DevOps project so the first step is to containerize the app which we include in the last commit. it's an ongoing project so we hope you find it useful :).
